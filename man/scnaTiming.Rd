}
\arguments{
\item{scnaFile}{the SCNA segmentation file}

\item{ssnvFile}{the SSNV file}

\item{sn}{sample name}

\item{outname}{output timing file name (including path)}

\item{public}{somatic timeline is focused on public mutations (across multi-samples) or not (otherwise, clonal variants in the specific sample)}

\item{pubOrSub}{the colname for column indicating if the mutation is public or not}

\item{skipchunk}{segments with number of data points (probes) no more than this number will be skipped}

\item{mmut}{minimum number of mutations for running timing analysis}

\item{qmethod}{the method for estimating q (probabilities of a randomly acquired mutation having allele state of aj/Nt)}
}
\value{
list: timing result; timing table (for visualization) and merged CNA data frame. For butte cases (non-identifiable), pi[1] is the lower bound, and pi[2] is the upper bound. piCI[1,] and piCI[2,] are the bootstrapped confidence interval for the two bounds, respectively.
